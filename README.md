Fork of the original [Blockify](https://github.com/BuffMage/Blockify) — overlays your Spotify playback on the Minecraft HUD: track title, artist, album art, progress bar, and volume.

### Requirements

- Minecraft **26.1.2** with **Fabric Loader** 0.19.2+ and **Fabric API**
- Java **25** or newer
- [MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib) 1.9.3+ (for the in-game config screen)
- A **Spotify Premium** account (the Web API endpoints used for playback control are Premium-only)

## How to use

Play a song on Spotify, then load into your server/world of choice. No Spotify authentication nor premium needed. To save a track to your Spotify library (press L), you'd need to authenticate your Spotify account. However, it is entirely optional.

### Default key bindings

| Action | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Play/Pause (or Authorize on first run) | `Num 5` |
| Previous Song | `Num 4` |
| Next Song | `Num 6` |
| Save current track to your library | `L` |
| Force Update | `Num 8` |
| Hide Blockify HUD | `Num 9` |
| Increase Volume | `Num +` |
| Decrease Volume | `Num -` |
| Toggle In-Game Music | `Num 1` |

All bindings can be remapped from the standard Minecraft Controls screen under the **Discify** category.

### Commands

- `/sharetrack` — sends a link to the currently playing track into chat (visible only to you).

### Configuration

Open the in-game config screen via Mod Menu → Discify. Available options include HUD scale, position, anchor corner, album-art toggle, custom colors for title/artist/time/progress bar/background, background transparency, in-game music volume, and volume step.
